# Getting Started with OCI DevOps
This is a sample project, using Python with Flask framework to create a simple weight convertor web application. With [OCI DevOps Service](https://www.oracle.com/devops/devops-service/) and this project, you'll be able to build, test and deploy this application to Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE).

In this example, you'll build a container image of the Python Flask app, push your built container to the OCI Container Registry (OCIR), then deploy the app to Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes (OKE) all using the OCI DevOps service.

## Running the example locally 

### Clone the Repository 
The first step is to download the repository to your local workspace.

```
git clone git@github.com:yashj0209/buildspec_python.git
cd buildspec_python
```

### Install the Requirements and Run the App
